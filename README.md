## About This game
> "CanYOU?" is an upcoming puzzle-horror game that is sure to please fans of the genre. The game features a dark and suspenseful atmosphere and challenging puzzles. In this game, **you will play as a detective who is trapped in a carnival which has a dark secret, and you must solve the mystery before it's too late. Or else...**

I have no idea which game I should make. So I asked AI (Artificial Intelligence) to become my personal assistant. Thanks to Gemini for helping me. Also, nice game title. I never know you would make that. Sounds a lot crazY!!W@!# (This is the first time I use Gemini on desktop LOL) Also, "CanYOU?" is a puzzle-horror game that was created using the Godot 4.3 game engine. Godot is a free and open-source game engine that is becoming increasingly popular among indie developers. It is known for its ease of use, flexibility, and powerful features.

> [!NOTE]
> "CanYOU?" is scheduled to be released in 2023. But the developer itself is lazy as ~~fuck~~ hell. He extended the schedule, and the game will be released in 2028. He said this to himself. Sometimes he has busy-week.
