# Upcoming puzzle-horror game "CanYOU?"
> About this game: "CanYOU?" is an upcoming puzzle-horror game that is sure to please fans of the genre. The game features a dark and suspenseful atmosphere and challenging puzzles. In this game, **you will play as a detective who is trapped in a carnival which has a dark secret, and you must solve the mystery before it's too late. Or else...**

I have no idea which game should I make. So I ask AI ```(Artificial Intelligence)``` to become my personal assistant. Thanks to Gemini for helping me. Also, nice game title. I never know you would make that. Sounds a lot crazY!!W@!#

> [!NOTE]
> "CanYOU?" is scheduled to be released in 2023. But the developer itself is lazy as ~~fuck~~ hell. He extended the schedule, and the game will be released in 2028. He said this to himself. Sometimes he has busy-week.
